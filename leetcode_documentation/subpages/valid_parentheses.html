        I'm honestly pretty satisfied with how the last page turned out,
        although there is still some formatting issues for me to fix. Anyways,
        for future entries, I think I should add some more of my thoughts and reasoning
        behind my design choices. For that one, I just saw the question way too
        far in advance; so my thoughts were kinda wild.

        Anyways, this question's easier than the last, partially because I want
        to try being more descriptive, and also because I'm currently in a bus and it's 
        shaking really badly hehe.

      <h2 class="thoughts-title">My Thoughts</h2>

      <p class="following-paragraph">
        My first question after reading this question was, "What does in order mean?" I guess it could
        mean that a parentheses opened before another one must also be closed before the other one.
        I'm going to test my hypothesis with "[]([)]," which I expect to output false, and "{([])},"
        which I expect to output true.
      </p>

      <p class="following-paragraph">
        My thoughts were correct. That means, when I see a closing bracket, I need to figure out what the 
        closest opening bracket was, and compare it to that. One type of data structure jumps out to me
        --a stack. The last in, first out nature of a stack would allow for me to push all opening brackets
        onto the stack as I see them, and I would be able to retrieve them as needed when I see a closing
        bracket.
      </p>

      <p class="following-paragraph">
        I'm going to use a for loop iterating through every element in the list, with the current element
        as my variable. The thought of revurion popped into my head initially, but I don't think the 
        extra variables stored on the call stack would be worth the simplicity.
      </p>

      <p class="following-paragraph">
        For every element, I will first check if it's a closing bracket. If not, I just push it onto the stack.
        If it is, however, I need to get its type, and compare it to the last opening bracket. If it doesn't
        match, I know I can instantly return false. Otherwise, I will move on and check all other elements
        in the list.
      </p>

      <p class="following-paragraph">
        In essence, my code is as follows:
      </p>
      <ol class="list--ordered">
        <li class="list__item">
          I make a stack to hold all of my brackets
        </li>
        <li class="list__item">
          I make a loop to iterate through all elements of the input
        </li>
        <li class="list__item">
          I check all the elements one by one. If it's an opening bracket, I push it onto the stack.
          Otherwise, I will do comparison.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <div class="code-demonstration">
        <code>
def valid_parentheses():
previous_brackets = []

for i in s:
    if i == '(' or i == '[' or i == '{':
        previous_brackets.push(i)
    elif i == ')':
        if previous_brackets.pop() != '(':
            return False
    elif i == ']':
        if previous_brackets.pop() != '[':
            return False
    else:
        if previous_brackets.pop() != '{':
            return False

return True
        </code>
      </div>

      <p class="following-paragraph">
        I'm not sure why, but I assumed that the input would be a valid pair of parentheses. Once
        I check for that, the code above works.

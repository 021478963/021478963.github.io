        This question marks day 2 of my adventures... Here's to many more! I need to start
        working on some other projects though, strong algorithm understanding won't really
        get me anywhere.

      <h2 class="question-title">The Question</h2>
      <blockquote class="question-content">
        A wonderful string is a string where at most one letter appears an odd number of times.
        <ol class="list--ordered">
          <li class="list__item">
            For example, "ccjjc" and "abab" are wonderful, but "ab" is not.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Given a string word that consists of the first ten lowercase English letters 
        ('a' through 'j'), return the number of wonderful non-empty substrings in word. If 
        the same substring appears multiple times in word, then count each occurrence separately.
        A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

      <p class="following-paragraph">
        I'm not going to lie, I thought the question was just asking for if the entire string
        was wonderful, and I was like, "That's really easy!" I guess nothing in life comes that 
        simply. Anyways, I think this question is doable with a sliding window and two pointers.
        I plan to have a right pointer representing the beginning of the window, and a left one 
        keeping track of the end of the window.

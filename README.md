🔎 I liked the idea of having something on the screen that interacts with the user <br>
🫧 I settled on a "bubble" that runs away (or towards) the cursor <br>
📈 I use simple kinematic equations to calculate how it moves! <br>
🦥 It also slows down depending on the distance from the cursor <br>
⚫ The bubble also inverts the colors behind it!
